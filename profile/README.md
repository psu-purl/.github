The [Pennsylvania State University Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research Laboratory](https://purl.psu.edu/) (PURL) performs advanced unmanned aircraft systems research, including flight-testing with a variety of research systems. PURL is within Penn State College of Engineering's Aerospace Engineering Department. The laboratory includes dedicated research vehicle systems (airplane, helicopter, multirotor, and more), a comprehensive set of simulation tools, dedicated space for indoor flight with motion capture systems, areas for aircraft maintenance/storage, an avionics workshop. The laboratory's recognized strengths are in adaptive/reliable flight control, vision-based control, and conducting flight validation. Most projects involve teaming with government/industrial partners and/or other academic units. The laboratory's graduates are highly sought after due to their knowledge/skills in control theory, software development, use of simulation, and familiarity with both a multi-disciplinary work environment and a safety culture. Professor Eric N. Johnson and Assistant Research Professor Thanakorn Khamvilai serve as Director and Co-Director of the laboratory, respectively.
